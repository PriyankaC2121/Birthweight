### Machine Learning: Birthweight prediction:

**Intro**  The World Health Organization (WHO) associates babies who are born with a weight less than 2500 grams (5.5 pounds) to be of low birthweight. Babies born with a low birthweight may be unhealthy / pose future complications for the parents and the hospitals. 

**Objective:** Develop a model to help parents understand which characteristics lead to low birth weight in babies

**Tools used:** Scikit â€“ learn, Train-test-split, Regressions (OLS, KNN, Ridge, Lasso), Visualization (Seaborn)
